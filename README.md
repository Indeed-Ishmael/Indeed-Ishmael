- 👋 Hi, my name is Ishmael.
- 👀 I’m interested in video games which is what this site is all about so.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about game design in a VET course.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not much at the moment except for following a tutorial for a 3D game on Unity for the game design course.
- 📫 How to reach me is by well I could say on Snapchat and TikTok but this a private account for the game design course so you know that you have me on Discord.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: A cup of tea can be pretty good.
